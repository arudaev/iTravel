## What is iTravel?

iTravel is a travel companion app for Android. Browse **60 hand-picked destinations** across 30+ countries on an interactive map, check the weather, scroll through beautiful travel photos, and leave reviews when you actually visit a place — the app uses your phone's GPS to make sure you're really there.

Whether you're planning your next trip or reminiscing about your last one, iTravel puts the world at your fingertips.

> [!NOTE]
> **This is V2** — a complete MVVM rewrite with a new UI/UX, expanded content, and modern architecture. See [Project History](#project-history) for details.

## Design

iTravel follows **Material Design 3** with a teal-and-orange palette inspired by ocean and sunset:

| | Color | Used For |
|---|-------|----------|
| 🟩 | **Teal** `#1E7B7E` | Buttons, headers, main accents |
| 🟩 | **Seafoam** `#2A9D8F` | Highlights, secondary touches |
| 🟧 | **Orange** `#F4A261` | Warm accents, category labels |
| 🟥 | **Coral** `#E76F51` | Action buttons, FABs, important alerts |
| ⬛ | **Dark Slate** `#264653` | Text, dark backgrounds |
| ⬜ | **Off White** `#F1FAEE` | Page backgrounds, cards |

The UI features smooth **slide and fade transitions** between screens, **fall-down animations** for list items, and a **collapsing toolbar** with hero images on location detail pages.

---

## Getting Started

You'll need an **Android phone** running version 8.0 or newer (most phones from 2017+).

1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Clone the project:
   ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/arudaev/iTravel.git
   ```
3. Open it in Android Studio and hit the green **Run** button
4. That's it — the app launches on your phone or emulator

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The map, travel photos, and weather features need free API keys to work. Without them the app still runs, but those sections will show placeholder content. See [docs/API_SETUP.md](docs/API_SETUP.md) for setup details.
